              Mastercard Foundation Scholars Program (MCFSP) provides academically talented yet economically disadvantaged young people in Africa with access to quality higher education. The Program offers an opportunity for its scholars to receive holistic training that empowers them to become change leaders. As such, Ms. Estella Obeng, a final year Mastercard Foundation Scholar studying BA Geography and Rural Development at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) has commissioned a Fashion Training Centre named; “African Dream School of Fashion” at Manso Agroyesum a community in the Manso Adubia township of the Amansie South District, Ashanti Region.ccording to Ms. Estella Obeng, the Manso Agroyesum community is faced with several challenges including teenage pregnancy. From her account she realised that a lot of young females in the community drop out of school as a result of unplanned pregnancies and they end up either as single mothers or given out to early marriages. To help such females, Ms. Obeng contacted some prominent stakeholders in the Agroyesum Community to look for a site for the establishment of the African Dream School of Fashion to train and equip these young females with fashion design skills for free.</p>

              In her speech, Ms. Obeng revealed that, after solely funding the establishment of the training facility with her savings from the monthly stipends she receives from MCFSP at KNUST, she contacted the Member of Parliament of the Manso Adubia Constituency, Honourable Yaw Addo Frimpong, who supported the initiative by donating five (5) sewing machines to facilitate the training of the young females.
